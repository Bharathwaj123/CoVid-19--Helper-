    <h2>What is corona virus?</h2>
    <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.<br>
    Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.<br>
     However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.<br>
     The first known infections from SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in Wuhan, China. The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear,<br>
      as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event.</p>
     <h2>HOW IT SPREADS:</h2><img src="https://www.sciencefriday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/people-wearing-masks.png"  width="30%">
     <p>The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe.<br>
         These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.<br>
        You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19,<br> or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.<br>
         The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings.</p>
    <h2>How severe is the coronavirus disease?</h2><img src="https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-75707659,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-416286,overlay-etpanache/photo.jpg" width="30%">
    <p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. <br>
        Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease,<br>
         and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</p>
    <h2>What are signs and symptoms of the coronavirus disease?</h2><img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/vectors/symptoms-of-patients-with-the-covid19-disease-from-coronavirus-about-vector-id1219966208?k=6&m=1219966208&s=170667a&w=0&h=kiEpnRVYpwGpLNU3N1T_ZP_k764VED-4AB4NhjkBzMo=" width="30%">
    <p>Signs and symptoms include respiratory symptoms and include fever, cough and shortness of breath.<br>
         In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome and sometimes death.

        Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include frequent cleaning of hands using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water;<br>
         covering the nose and mouth with a flexed elbow or disposable tissue when coughing and sneezing; and avoiding close contact with anyone that has a fever and cough.</p>
    <h2>What is the incubation period for COVID-19?</h2><img src="https://www.careinsurance.com/upload_master/media/posts/March2020/JgnRIO4PkbiB7Ewh4378.jpg" width="30%">
    <p>Symptoms show up in people within two to 14 days of exposure to the virus. A person infected with the coronavirus is contagious to others for up to two days before symptoms appear,<br>
        and they remain contagious to others for 10 to 20 days, depending upon their immune system and the severity of their illness.</p>
    <h2>How is COVID-19 treated?</h2><img src="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/sebin/n/z/COVID-ICU-illustration.jpg" width="30%">
    <p>Treatment for COVID-19 addresses the signs and symptoms of the infection and supports people with more severe disease. For mild cases of coronavirus disease,<br>
         your doctor may recommend measures such as fever reducers or over-the-counter medications. More severe cases may require hospital care,<br>
          where a patient may receive a combination of treatments that could include steroids, oxygen, mechanical breathing support and other COVID-19 treatments in development.<br>
           Infusions of monoclonal antibodies given to certain patients early in the infection may reduce the symptoms, severity and duration of the illness.</p>
    <h2>Does COVID-19 cause death?</h2> <img src="https://interviewtimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6300ecf990f83e9f4a3b87e1f7128d93.jpg" width="30%">
    <p>Yes, severe COVID-19 can be fatal. For updates of coronavirus infections, deaths and vaccinations worldwide,<br>
         see the Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases map developed by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering.</p>
